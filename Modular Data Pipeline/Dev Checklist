Modular Data Pipeline Checklist

Step 1: Understand the Overall Pipeline Design
X Define the ETL process structure (Ingestion, Transformation, Validation, Load/Publish).
X Identify clear boundaries for each module's responsibilities.

Step 2: Set Up the AWS Environment
X Create S3 buckets with folders for raw, transformed, and validated data.
X Register databases and tables in the Glue Data Catalog.
X Configure IAM roles with least privilege for Glue, Lambda, and Step Functions.

Step 3: Develop Modular Code
X Write reusable utility functions (e.g., S3 access, table registration).
X Organize utility functions in a shared library or Lambda Layer.
X Build ingestion scripts that read raw data and store it in S3.
X Develop transformation scripts applying business rules and cleansing.
X Create validation scripts for schema checks, row counts, and null values.
X Implement publish scripts to load data into Redshift or register it in Athena.

Step 4: Implement Orchestration with Step Functions
X Design Step Functions workflows for each pipeline stage.
X Add retry logic and error handling for each step.
X Include conditional logic for branching based on data quality or business rules.
X Trigger notifications (via SNS) for critical events or failures.

Step 5: Incorporate Data Quality Checks
X Validate schemas against the Glue Data Catalog.
X Perform completeness checks (e.g., row counts, null values).
X Implement business rule validations for key metrics.
X Use custom exceptions (e.g., ValidationError, SchemaError) for errors.

Step 6: Build Logging and Monitoring
X Log execution details for all steps in CloudWatch Logs.
X Use structured JSON logs for easy querying.
X Configure CloudWatch Alarms for anomalies or failures.
X Set up SNS for alert notifications (e.g., email, Slack).

Step 7: Testing and Deployment
X Create separate environments for development, staging, and production.
X Test each pipeline step independently.
X Conduct end-to-end tests before deployment.
X Monitor Glue and Lambda job costs for optimization.

Step 8: Documentation
X Write a README for each module (purpose, inputs, outputs).
X Create a high-level diagram of the pipelineâ€™s architecture and data flow.
X Document configuration settings and their uses in YAML/JSON.
